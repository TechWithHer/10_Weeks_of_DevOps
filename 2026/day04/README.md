# Day 04 – Basic Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers

**#90DaysOfDevOps | TrainWithShubham**

## Objective

Understand the **basics of Linux Shell Scripting** and how it is used by DevOps engineers to automate tasks, handle inputs, and make decisions.

---

## ✍️ PART 1: WRITEUPS (Conceptual Understanding)

### 1. What is a Kernel?

The **kernel** is the core component of an operating system.
It has complete control over system resources such as:

* CPU
* Memory
* Disk
* Network
* Hardware devices

The kernel acts as a **bridge between hardware and software**, ensuring programs can run safely and efficiently.

---

### 2. What is a Shell?

A **shell** is a user-level program that provides an interface to interact with the operating system.

* It accepts **human-readable commands**
* Translates them into instructions the **kernel** understands
* Executes commands from:

  * Keyboard (terminal)
  * Script files

The shell starts when a user logs in or opens a terminal.

Examples of shells:

* bash
* sh
* zsh
* fish

---

### 3. What is Linux Shell Scripting?

Shell scripting is the practice of writing **scripts (files containing commands)** that are executed by a shell.

Shell scripts are commonly used to:

* Automate repetitive tasks
* Manage files and directories
* Run programs
* Set up environments
* Perform system administration

---

### 4. Shell Scripting for DevOps (In Simple Words)

For DevOps engineers, shell scripting means:

* Automating deployments
* Writing startup scripts
* Managing servers
* Handling CI/CD pipeline steps
* Debugging production issues quickly

Example use cases:

* Restarting failed services
* Cleaning logs
* Setting environment variables
* Automating backups

---

### 5. What is `#!/bin/bash`?

`#!/bin/bash` is called a **shebang**.

* It tells the system **which interpreter** should execute the script
* `/bin/bash` specifies the Bash shell

👉 Yes, you **can also use**:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
```

But:

* `bash` supports more features
* `sh` is more minimal and portable

In DevOps, **bash is most commonly used**.

---

## 🛠️ PART 2: TASKS / EXERCISES (Hands-on Practice)

### Task 1: Conceptual

* Explain in your own words what **Shell Scripting means for DevOps**
* Mention at least **one real DevOps use case**

---

### Task 2: Basic Script

Write a shell script that prints:

```
I will complete #90DaysOfDevOps challenge
```

---

### Task 3: User Input & Arguments

Write a shell script that:

* Takes input from the user
* Takes input from command-line arguments
* Prints all variables clearly

---

### Task 4: Conditional Logic

Write a shell script using **if-else** to:

* Compare two numbers
* Print which number is greater (or if they are equal)

---

### Task 5: Reflection

* Was shell scripting difficult?
* What part was confusing or interesting?

---

### Learn in Public (Recommended)

Share your Day 04 progress on LinkedIn:

* What you learned about shell scripting
* One script you found interesting
* Any challenge you faced
